                taught us Java so that we develop Android applications. I was
                part of the second cohort they offered. I enjoyed the
                experience, and I learned a lot even though I did not kept
                going; also, I met some really cool people during the program.
                The cohort lasted six months, and during that time, we learned
                the basics of Java to develop. I do not know why I did not stick
                with it, but it was not appealing to me at the time; maybe I had
                impostor syndrome ,or perhabs I was not ready at the time, who

                doing the front-end developer program they have. As you may
                know, at this point, I was learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                For my final project, I went, and took the deliberation of
                learning Angular; up to this day, I still remember the struggle
                I had with it, but I liked it nevertheless. And again, after the
                program, I did not continue programming; at that time, I felt
                that I did not learn enough, that I was not ready, that
                programming was not for me, and leave it like that.

              <p class="blog-content">
                <span class="first-letter">A</span>fter Fullstack I stopped
                programming for around two years. I completely forgot about it,
                but one day it hit me again the need to learn to program. This
                time, I decided to learn python. It might be the "easiest"
                programming language to learn. I really like it and enjoy
                writing python code; whoever, I got caught in what is called
                tutorial hell. I was watching tutorials for everything that has
                to do with python, but I was not writing code or creating
                projects. I even bought some Udemy courses but did not follow
                through. I was putting a lot of pressure on myself at the time,
                I felt stupid for not knowing or understanding a topic and that
                got me discouraged. And again I stopped programming altogether.
                Fast forward to two years ago, during the beginning of the
                pandemic, I got accepted into
                <span

                >. It's a free program for CUNY students that are interested in
                learning Fullstack Web App Dev using Javascript or Data science
                using Python. I was taking classes when I got accepted, and I
                did not want to lose the opportunity. I was a bit overwhelmed
                with everything.

                <span class="first-letter">I</span> took advantage of the
                pandemic, and that classes were online, moved to the Dominican
                Republic to save some money; since I was not working at the time
                and classes were remote. That way, I could focus on my school
                classes as well as the program classes. During the program, we
                were learning Machine Learning. We used python and learned about
                pandas and other python libraries. I found the program hard,
                maybe because of everything that was happening. I got
                discouraged. Feeling overwhelmed and stressed all the time got
                me nowhere. I was not handling the program's homework on time. I
                felt like I did not belong there; I felt like an outsider. Most
                of the students were taking college classes related to the
                topic. The final project was in team of two. We built a machine
                model that analyzes the sentiments of twitter's tweets. He did
                most of the heavy lifting. I did more the front-end. Do not get
                me wrong, I love learning, and I learned a lot during this
                program, but I was not ready yet. At this point you already know
                what I did next, yup!, you guessed it, I stopped programming
                completely. I told myself that I was done with programming;
                after all these years and programs I went through. I did want to
                deal with programming.

                did not apply since I told myself that I did not want to do the
                same again. I did not want to feel discouraged one more time, so
                I close the window and forgot about it. Call it faith if you
                want, but five days before the application's deadline, I saw the
                Citi group scholarship again. Honestly, I did want to apply for
                the scholarship since I was "done with programming"; however, I
                applied. To complete the application process, you have to
                complete the HTML and CSS courses Udacity offers. A week or so
                later, we received the final assignment, a test based on Java,
                SQL, HTML, and CSS. This "exam" that we had to take would
                determine whether or not we get granted a scholarship. They were
                offering only 100 scholarships, which meant that the first 100
                participants with the highest score would get accepted. To my
                surprise, I got accepted!!!!

                not as if I was not building projects before. Now, I am
                practicing programming every day and building stuff on my own.
                Currently, I am creating my website. I can say now that I am
                starting to like programming. I know it will be hard. I am 100%
                sure that it will be challenging, but I know 1000% that in the
                end is going to be worth it. I know that with a goal in mind and
                with some discipline you can accomplish anything you set your
