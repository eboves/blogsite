Would I do it again?

The answer is YES. 

Would I have try to learn how to code again if I could go back in time? Yes I would. However that is NOT the most important question to ask that would be What have you done different if you have the opportunity to start over again. To that question my answer would be have a GOAL and a PLAN before you start. Programming is easy BUT not simple. typing some random "code" on the computer is easy the hard part is understanding what the code does and IF there is a better way to write the code. 

Programming is Hard I am not going to lie it is a nice skill to have under your belt but it is not an easy one to learn and the best and faster way to learn it is by actually writing a lot of code. That something that every person who have learned how to program can rely with. 

I like to quote that says "If you dont have a destination you have already arrived" If you dont have a goal in mind of why you would like to learn programming it will take you a lot and I MEAN a lot of time to learn programming. You may say "Elvis but why it will take me a lot of time to learn how to program" and the main reason is because there are more programming languages out there that happy people in the world (crying laughing face) to name a few:
Python
Java
Javascript (not related to Java)
C
C++
Go
Ruby
and the list goes on and on and on

ADD IMGS FOR EACH

There are different routes you can take as a programmer:
You can be a data scients: a person who can create a story with a given data for this you have to learn:
Python or R

Front-end developer: Deals with everything you SEE when you open a website
What to learn:
HTML --> Skeleton of a website (nound)
CSS --> Design of a website
Javasript --> Functionality of a website (Verb)



ADD THIS IN THIS AND THE PREVIOUS ARTICLE

I am going to do something that might pissed some people and I will used programming to define the art of writing code and programmer the person who write the code.
